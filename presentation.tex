\begin{frame}{Description}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->] 
        \item Keys lock up and secure your things
        \item We need cryptographic protocols...
        \item BB84 is the first Quantum Key Distribution protocol
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Description}
    A QKD protocol that provides a way to share an unconditionally secure key in the presence of an eavesdropper.\\
    For this protocol we require two communication channels : 
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item QAC - 
        \item CAC - 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{BB84 Protocol}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Alice and Bob prepare pseudo keys using QAC and CAC
        \item Information Reconciliation to improvise the noisy version of Bob's key
        \item Privacy Amplification to reduce Eve's information of the key
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Difficulties faced}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Getting started with Quantum Computing
        \item In choosing a sub-domain
        \item Unsure about the language and tools to use
